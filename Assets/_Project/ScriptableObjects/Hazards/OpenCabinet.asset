  <RiskExplaination>k__BackingField: The cabinet should be closed to avoid someone
    hitting it.
  <FeedbackCorrectType>k__BackingField: Correct! Kitchen drawers and cabinets should
    remain closed when they are not in use so they do not create a tripping hazard.

    is a tripping hazard. Kitchen drawers and cabinets should remain closed when
    they are not in use.

    of the potential hazard and close any open drawers and cabinets. '
  <FeedbackIncorrectResponse>k__BackingField: 'Sorry, that''s not the best option.

    aware of the potential hazard and close any open drawers and cabinets. '
