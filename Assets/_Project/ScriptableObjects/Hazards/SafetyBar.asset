  <RiskExplaination>k__BackingField: The safetybar is on the floor instead of being
    correctly installed.
  <FeedbackCorrectType>k__BackingField: Correct! Properly installed safety handles
    are a required feature for this client's bathtub. While every client's situation
    is different and they may or may not need a safety handle, this particular client's
    home should have a safety handle that is securely installed to reduce the risk
    of slipping.
  <FeedbackIncorrectType>k__BackingField: Sorry, that's not the best option. This
    is a slipping hazard. Clients who require safety handles could slip in a bathtub
    if they do not have a properly installed handle to use.
  <FeedbackCorrectResponse>k__BackingField: That's right! In most cases, a Home Safety
    Inspection will be completed by your supervisor or organization to determine
    which safety features a client's home needs. In this client's case, safety handles
    are required in the bathtub to reduce the risk of slipping. Since you have been
    made aware that the client requires safety handles, you should report their absence
    to the client and your supervisor.
