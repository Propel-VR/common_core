  <RiskExplaination>k__BackingField: Someone could trip on the cardboard boxes in
    the driveway.
  <FeedbackCorrectType>k__BackingField: Nicely done! This was a bonus hazard that
    not everyone finds. Objects left on the driveway can be tripping hazards, especially
    when it is dark outside.
  <FeedbackIncorrectType>k__BackingField: Hmm. This would be considered a tripping
    hazard. Boxes and other objects left on the driveway can be tripping hazards,
    especially when it is dark outside. Nicely done, though! This was a bonus hazard
    that not everyone finds.
