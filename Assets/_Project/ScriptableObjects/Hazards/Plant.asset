  <RiskExplaination>k__BackingField: The plant is too close to the fireplace and
    could catch in fire.
  <FeedbackCorrectType>k__BackingField: Correct! Plants or other objects should not
    be near a fireplace or open flame as they can create a fire hazard.
  <FeedbackIncorrectType>k__BackingField: Sorry, that's not the best option. This
    is a fire hazard. Plants or other objects should not be near a fireplace or open
    flame as they can catch fire.
  <FeedbackCorrectResponse>k__BackingField: That's right! Make your client aware
    of the object that could create a fire hazard and move it immediately.
  <FeedbackIncorrectResponse>k__BackingField: Sorry, that's not the best option.
    You should report it to the client and take care of it yourself. Make your client
    aware of the object that could create a fire hazard and move it immediately.
