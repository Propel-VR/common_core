  <FeedbackCorrectType>k__BackingField: Correct! Hairdryers and other electrical
    equipment need to be plugged into a GCFI outlet if they are used in the bathroom,
    otherwise they create an electrical hazard. If there is no GCFI outlet available
    in the bathroom, use these tools in another room.
  <FeedbackIncorrectType>k__BackingField: Sorry, that's not the best option. This
    is an electrical hazard. Hairdryers and other electrical equipment need to be
    plugged into a GCFI outlet if they are used in the bathroom, otherwise they create
    an electrical hazard. If there is no GCFI outlet available in the bathroom, use
    these tools in another room.
  <FeedbackCorrectResponse>k__BackingField: That's right! Make your client aware
    of this potential electrical hazard and remove the hairdryer from the non-GCFI
    outlet. You should also recommend always using the GCFI outlet in the bathroom
    and moving to another room if there is not one available to your client .
