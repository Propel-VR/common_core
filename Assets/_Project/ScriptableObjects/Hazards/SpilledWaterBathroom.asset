  <RiskExplaination>k__BackingField: A shower mat is missing. The client could slip
    in the bathub.
  <FeedbackCorrectType>k__BackingField: Correct! A rubber bath mat should be adhered
    to this client's tub/shower surfaces to prevent the risk of slipping.
  <FeedbackIncorrectType>k__BackingField: 'Sorry, that''s not the best option. This
    is a slipping hazard. This client requires a rubber bath mat in all tubs/showers,
    and their absense could cause the client to slip and fall. '
  <FeedbackCorrectResponse>k__BackingField: That's right! In most cases, a Home Safety
    Inspection will be completed by your supervisor or organization to determine
    which safety features a client's home needs. In this client's case, a rubber
    mat in the tub/shower is required to reduce the risk of slipping. Since you are
    aware that the client requires a rubber mat, you should report its absence to
    your client and your supervisor.
