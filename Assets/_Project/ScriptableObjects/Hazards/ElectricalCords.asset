  <RiskExplaination>k__BackingField: 
  <FeedbackCorrectType>k__BackingField: Correct! Electrical cords that run in the
    middle of walking areas can be a tripping hazard.
  <FeedbackIncorrectType>k__BackingField: "Sorry, that\u2019s not the best option.
    This is a tripping hazard. Clients could trip on electrical cords that run through
    areas they typically move through."
  <FeedbackCorrectResponse>k__BackingField: That's right! You should make your client
    award of the hazardous cord so they do not trip, and safely reposition any electrical
    cords that are running through any area they may move through. It is not necessary
    to report this to your supervisor so long as repositioning the cords is manageable
    and taken care of immediately.
  <FeedbackIncorrectResponse>k__BackingField: Sorry, that's not the best option.
    You should report it to the client and take care of it yourself. You should make
    your client award of the hazardous cord so they do not trip, and safely reposition
    any electrical cords that are running through any area they may move through.
    It is not necessary to report this to your supervisor so long as repositioning
    the cords is manageable and taken care of immediately.
